            <p>
                This is the Game Session Tracker I made for my User Interface Design class. Users can add games and
                create journal entries specific to a given game.
            </p>
            <p>The Github repository for this project can be found <a

            <h1>Design Work</h1>
            <h2>Interviewing</h2>

            <p>Question: What are some things about a game that arenâ€™t directly related to the experience of the game
                that you might want to note down or track?</p>
            <p>Answer: Games similar to the game, other games by the creators, genre of the game, time played</p>

            <p>Question: Do you think it is good to continually track your play experience of a single game?</p>
            <p>Answer: a. It can be cool to make multiple submissions to a single game entry as opposed to a single
                large review at the end of the game. It lets you keep a bigger range of thoughts instead of just
                thoughts from when you are done with the game.</p>

            <p>Question: How would you use this for board games?</p>
            <p>Answer: Similar to a video game. Maybe tracking who i played it with and who won.</p>

            <p>Question: How would you use this for video games?</p>
            <p>Answer: I would want to track the good and bad things about a play session. People I played with maybe.
            </p>

            <h2>Sketching</h2>
            <p>Here are some of my sketches:</p>
            <figure><img class="thumbnail" src="images/SketchOne.png"></figure>
            <figure><img class="thumbnail" src="images/SketchTwo.png"></figure>
            <figure><img class="thumbnail" src="images/SketchThree.png"></figure>
            <figure><img class="thumbnail" src="images/SketchFour.png"></figure>
            <figure><img class="thumbnail" src="images/SketchFive.png"></figure>

            <h2>Feedback</h2>
            <p>During my creation of the website I got feedback about the visual styling from friends. This was about
                things like font size, colors and spacing.</p>

            <h1>Interface Description</h1>

            <h2>Game Carousel</h2>
            <figure><img class="thumbnail" src="images/GameCarousel.png"></figure>
            <p>The Game Carousel allows you to select the current game. It will dislpay a maximum of five games at a
                time. The arrows can be used to scroll left or right to change the currently displayed games. The 'Add
                Game' button allows the user to add a new game to the carousel</p>

            <h2>Game Information</h2>
            <figure><img class="thumbnail" src="images/GameInformation.png"></figure>
            <p>Game Information displays the cover, title, genre, develovper, total playtime, and number of goals a
                game has. </p>

            <h2>Add Game</h2>
            <figure><img class="thumbnail" src="images/AddGame.png"></figure>
            <p>Add Game allows the user to add a new game. It is activated through the 'Add Game' button in the Game
                Carousel. It replaces the Game Information until the new game is submitted or the action is canceled.
            </p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <figure><img class="thumbnail" src="images/Goals.png"></figure>
            <p>Goals allows the user to track goals for their game. The checkmark can be clicked to mark a goal as
                completed. New goals can be added when the user is adding a new entry to the game.
            </p>

            <h2>My Entries</h2>
            <figure><img class="thumbnail" src="images/Entries.png"></figure>
            <p>My Entries shows all of the entries made for a game. The selector on the left allows the user to select
                an entry to be displayed on the right. The selector displays entries by the date they were submitted.
                The entry shows the time played for the session, the rating of the session and things the user liked or
                disliked about the session. The circle next to the rating changes color based on the rating starting at
                red for 1 and changing to green at 10. The 'Edit Entry' button allows the user to edit the current
                entry.
            </p>

            <h2>Add Entry</h2>
            <figure><img class="thumbnail" src="images/AddEntry.png"></figure>
            <p>
                Submit a New Entry allows the user to create a new entry for the currently selected game. The can log
                things they liked or disliked, a general rating of 1-10, and the playtime of the session. They can also
                add a new goal to their goals tracker.
            </p>

            <h2>Edit Entry</h2>
            <figure><img class="thumbnail" src="images/Edit Entry.png"></figure>
            <p>
                Edit an Entry allows the user to edit a specified entry. It is accessed through the 'Edit Entry' button
                in My Entries.
            </p>

            <h1>Implementation</h1>
            <p>This was created using base Svelte. The default demo data is saved in a store. This store is used for
                further data added by the user. </p>


            <h1>Future Work</h1>
            Some future things that could be added/worked on:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Highlight the currently selected entry in the entry selector for 'My Entries'.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add 'Days since last entry' and 'Days since first entry' to 'Game Information'.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Improved styling for 'Edit Entry' and 'Add Game'.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fix the functionality of edit entry. Not all fields are currently editable (rating and playtime).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add functionality for custom covers for added games.
